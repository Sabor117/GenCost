# Meta-analysis description for <CURRENT_TRAIT>

# Meta-analysis weighted by standard error does not work well
# when different studies used very different transformations.
# If wishing to use a standard error approach then SAMPLESIZE
# should be replaced with "STDERR"
# SAMPLESIZE is the default for METAL however.

SCHEME SAMPLESIZE

# Usually, it is a good to apply genomic control to each
# input file. However, in this example, all the markers being
# examined reside in strongly associated loci and it probably 
# is not a good idea. To find out what happens if you turn
# on genomic control, uncomment the following line.

GENOMICCONTROL ON

# To help identify allele flips, it can be useful to track
# allele frequencies in the meta-analysis.
# This capability can be cancelled by commenting the following two lines.

AVERAGEFREQ ON
MINMAXFREQ ON

# To restrict meta-analysis to two previously reported SNPs uncomment the next
# command line.
# ADDFILTER SNP IN (rs10830963,rs563694)

# Option to include chromosome and position in the output file
# This also tracks the SNPs to make sure CHR + POS match across SNPs

TRACKPOSITIONS ON
CHROMOSOMELABEL chr
POSITIONLABEL pos

# To turn on the summarizing of study specific results for each variant
# Uncomment the following command line.

# VERBOSE ON

# Standardized METAL input columns

# PROCESS command must be applied to each file name.
# Standardizing input makes this simple.

# Actually run the analysis
# Include analsis of heterogeneity, but if you want to change this, just delete the 
# heterogeneity part of the command
